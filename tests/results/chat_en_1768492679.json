  "data": "Gravity is like a big hug from the Earth. The Earth wants to keep everything close to it, so it pulls on everything that is near. That's why you don't float off into space when you're standing on the ground. It's also why things fall down when you drop them, like a ball or a toy. The Earth is giving them a big hug and pulling them down to the ground.",
