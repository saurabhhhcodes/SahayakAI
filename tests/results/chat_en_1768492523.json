  "data": "Gravity is like a big hug from the Earth. The Earth wants to keep everyone and everything close to it, so it pulls us towards it. That's why you don't float off into space when you're standing on the ground. It's like when you give your favorite toy or stuffed animal a big hug and you want to keep it close to you. The Earth is giving us a big hug with its gravity, and that's what keeps us on the ground.",
